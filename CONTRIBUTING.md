# Contributing to Mini Workflow Engine

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Mini Workflow Engine! It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with:

*   **Reporting a bug**
*   **Discussing the current state of the code**
*   **Submitting a fix**
*   **Proposing new features**
*   **Becoming a maintainer**

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY/issues).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, please [open a new one](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing one, please open an issue on GitHub. Clearly describe the proposed enhancement, why it would be beneficial, and any potential implementation ideas.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `main` (or `master`).
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes.
4.  Make sure your code lints.
5.  Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

*   Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
*   Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
*   Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
*   Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

### Code Style

[TODO: Add any specific code style guidelines for Python, React, etc. For example, mention if you use Black for Python or Prettier for JavaScript/React.]

## Any questions?

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out by opening an issue.

**Please replace `YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY` with your actual GitHub username and repository name once you've set it up on GitHub.**
